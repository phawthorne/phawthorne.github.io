    Activity
        ROOT is used to inform spatial problems about where to undertake different management actions or changes. We use the term "activity" to refer generally to any action or investment that needs to be spatially allocated. The result of a single optimization from ROOT will be a table indicating which activities, if any, to assign to each spatial decision unit. Some of these activities may not require any physical action (e.g. allocation of protection to natural areas).

    Factor
        The analyses that ROOT performs are based on characteristics of each spatial decision unit and activity that determine whether an activity allocation is good for the specified objectives, or obeys rules (constraints) that the decision is subject to. We refer generally to any of these characteristics as a 'factor'. Specifically, factors show up as the columns in the tables output from the preprocessing steps, and are calculated from the raster and shape inputs.

    Spatial decision unit (SDU)
        Rather than making pixel-level decisions, ROOT optimizes activity allocation at a more aggregated spatial scale. The unit of decision is called the spatial decision unit (SDU). These can be customized by the user, or ROOT can create a grid of equal-area squares or hexagons.


Data preparation

Preprocessing
--------------
The preprocessing step converts the spatial input data to a tabular form that summarizes the input data at the SDU level, as needed by the optimization step. This section describes each of the types of data inputs and how they are used.

SDU map
~~~~~~~~
The map of spatial decision units can either be provided by the user as a custom map, or generated automatically by ROOT as a regular grid of squares or hexagons. A user provided map makes sense when there are relevant decision boundaries, e.g. subwatershed outlines, a list of proposed projects, or political/ownership parcels. For a more generalized analysis, ROOT can generate a map of equal-area squares or hexagons.

Rasters
~~~~~~~

Raster data captures spatially-explicit value of a given activity towards a given factor. For each raster, the preprocessing step will calculate the total score per SDU by summing all the pixels that overlap with allowed pixels in the corresponding mask.

**Raster data + SDU grid --> activity value table**

Shapefiles
~~~~~~~~~~

Shapefiles are used to provide non-activity related data, such as defining spatially dependent weights for different factors, or defining regions for setting targets or constraints. For each shapefile, the user will indicate which fields
